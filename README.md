Tests from various classes at TJHSST. Please feel free to add tests, just make sure to censor out private information, put accurate tests and from ONLY TJHSST in the folders, and put the correct tests in the correct folders.  This material will help you study for the next test/quiz.  Everything here is legal. According to the head of the math department at TJ, we are allowed to study from previous tests. 

ALSO: some of the questions are wrong. I recommend not to use the tests as answer keys, rather as potential questions. Look up answer keys on Google...
