These are the tests for the AP BC Calculus course. Tests were administered during the 2017-18 school year.

Note: In order to protect the identity of the students (in other words, not embarrass them because of their low scores), we have censored all names, periods, etc. Studying from old tests is completely legal and does not violate any sort of school policy (according to Ms. Razzino, head of the math department).

Chapter 6, 7, 8, and the Multi/"3D" (quest) unit tests are missing from this folder as of 6/30/18. Please add them in if you find them.

Also, of the tests I have, I am pretty sure I have them in their entirety. If not, please check with other people and try to get them.

Thank you!
